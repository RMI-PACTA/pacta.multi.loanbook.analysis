# pacta.multi.loanbook.analysis (development version)

* Fix: Ensure that company level disaggregations into buildout/phaseout metrics
always have both directions. Fill missing rows with 0 values.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Replaced references to green/brown with references to increasing/decreasing,
in line with changes in `r2dii.data` and `r2dii.analysis`
